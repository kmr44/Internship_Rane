# Rane Steering Systems – R&D Internship (May–June 2025)

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables from my 4-week internship at **Rane Steering Systems**, where I worked in the **Research & Development division** focused on **manual steering column design, and benchmarking** for commercial vehicles.

During the internship, I contributed to design evaluation projects, learned about steering component testing methods, and developed a detailed comparison matrix for steering column sleeve designs under real-world OEM constraints.
